Intance and Static methods

Instance methods
Instance methods in different class is accessed using an instance
Ex: Sample sample = new Sample();
	sample.instanceMethod();
Instance methods in the same class is also accessed using an instance
Ex: OOPS o = new OOPS();
	o.instanceMethod();

Static methods
Static method in different class is not accessed using an instance, but instead using Classname
Ex: Sample.staticmethod();		//Where Sample is classname
Static method in same class does not need any instance to be called
Ex: staticmethod();				//Where the method is in same class
