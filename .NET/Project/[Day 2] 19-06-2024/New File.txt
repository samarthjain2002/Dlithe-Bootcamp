The Learning Management System (LMS):
It allows users to register and log in, with roles assigned as Admin, Instructor, or Student.
Admins can manage courses and users, while instructors can create and manage course content, including text, videos, PDFs, and quizzes.
Students can browse and enroll in courses, access materials, and track their progress through course completion markers and feedback on quizzes.
Each course will have a discussion forum for threaded communication between students and instructors.
The system must send notifications for course updates and deadlines and allow admins and instructors to generate and export reports on student progress and course performance.
